# team
### HQ'ers, the [Airtable with your info is here](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invgnVcC5Hrs5O9VZ&inviteToken=0341506c21006470a934631546c84dcbe42ac52d3093b7f4b4ca51eaef654a82&utm_medium=email&utm_source=product_team&utm_content=transactional-alerts).
It's historically been tricky for less code-inclined Hack Club staff members to update their bios etc. on hackclub.com/team.

As I'm building out The Hack Foundation's new website, and need a team page for that as well, I thought it would be worthwile to have one source of truth for teams' descriptions.

(There is an automation on the Airtable base that POSTs to `fn notify_team_change` when a record is updated.)
