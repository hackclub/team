### HQ'ers, the [Airtable with your info is here](https://airtable.com/app79wD9AFys1NMUp/tblA6yg7IbnPPUkFb/viwtpiUu25UKnTeDO?blocks=hide).
It's historically been tricky for less code-inclined Hack Club staff members to update their bios etc. on hackclub.com/team.

As I'm building out The Hack Foundation's new website, and need a team page for that as well, I thought it would be worthwile to have one source of truth for teams' descriptions.

(There is an automation on the Airtable base that POSTs to `fn notify_team_change` when a record is updated.)
